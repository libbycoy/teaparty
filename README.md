# Blog experiment

The following is a blog experiment which I created at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/).

This is one of the first experiments I did at General Assembly and uses the [Particle Ground](https://github.com/jnicol/particleground) plugin. I experimented a lot with css transitions and scrolling.

## Key Features
* jquery smooth scroll features
* appearing text
* particle background

##Bugs/Issues/"Features"
* Smooth scrolling only works once menu items are clicked twice

### Enjoy!
